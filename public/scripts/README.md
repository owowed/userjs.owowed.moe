# owowed-userscripts

This repository contains a collection of my public userscripts for various websites. Userscripts are small JavaScript programs that can be installed in web browsers to add or modify website functionality.

## Installation

To use any of the userscripts in this repository, you'll need a userscript manager extension installed in your web browser. Here are some popular userscript managers:
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
- [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
- [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)

Once you have a userscript manager installed, simply choose one of the userscript available below under [Available Userscripts](#available-userscripts), and click the `Install` button. Your userscript manager should automatically detect the file and prompt you to install it.

## Available Userscripts

- **YouTube Raw Transcript** ([Install][ytrt-install], [LGPL-3.0][LGPL3]): A userscript that adds a button in the video's transcript panel, with the functionality of generating a raw video transcript you can copy-paste.
- **YouTube Preview Handle** ([Install][ytph-install], [LGPL-3.0][LGPL3]): A userscript that will add a YouTube username handle on the right side of a channel name. Will work across video channel name, homepage, YouTube post, and more.
